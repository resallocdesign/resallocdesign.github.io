          For three decades, a charitable organization known as Mercy Corps has
          helped support children in need around the globe. <br /> <br /> The
          organization runs programs in dozens of countries to help children get
          access to food, shelter, and education. In all of the work they do,
          cost effectiveness is highly important to the organization, as they
          want donorsâ€™ money to go to the ones who need it the most--the
          children. <br /> <br /> Their financial report indicates that 87% of
          their money went directly to programs that support people in need.
          (The remaining 13% covers administrative costs.) <br /> <br />
